goal of the project is to  create a Library system that will let you read books
books are organized based on three generes:Literature, Science, Natural History and options a,b,c to let the user select them 
all these options are in the main menu under the main fucntion along with q to quit the program
there is a dictionary for each genere
a function to tell the user which shelf they are in 
a fucntion to ask if after reading a book user would like to go back to the main menu
a fucntion for quitting it
a fucntion to read the fist 25 lines of the selected book and then asks if they woud like to continue reading 
  if the user says yes, continues,if user says no, takes them back to main menu
program also tells reader when they have reached the end of the book
handles errors like typing wrong book by using flag and while loop
